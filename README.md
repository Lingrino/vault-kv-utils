Useful functions in Go for Hashicorp Vault.

Currently under active devlopment.

Terminology:
- A `path` in vault references a location. This location can either be a secret itself or a folder containing secrets. A clean path does not start or end with a `/`
- A `key` is the same as a path *except* that it can end in a `/`, signifying for certain that it is a folder
- A `folder` is a `key` that ends in a `/`. Folders are not secrets, but they contain secrets and/or other folders
- In this repo all functions prefixed with `Path` act once on the path specified. `PathDelete()` calls delete on that path and stops. On the other hand, all function starting with `Folder` call their `Path` equivalent on all keys within, recursively. `PathDelete()` deletes a single `path` and `FolderDelete()` deletes an entire `folder`.

Planned Functions:
- Path List
- Path Read
- Path Search
- Path Delete
- Path Copy
- Path Diff
- Folder List
- Folder Read
- Folder Search
- Folder Delete
- Folder Copy
- Folder Diff
- Policy Enforce
- Approle Enforce
